# ECE-355
Final project for ECE 355 Lab Portion

Written by Stefan Bichlmaier

The program performs the following:
1. Read the voltage across the wiper of a potentiometer with the built in ADC
1. Convert the voltage to a calibrated resistance
1. Display the resistance on a 16x2 LCD
1. Pass the input voltage to a 555 timer circuit with the built in DAC
1. Calculate the resulting frequency of the 555 timer
